# Baggage handling simulation

This repository contains an implementation of an airport baggage handling
simulation.

Flights arrive to an airport and may contain some bags that have to be
transferred to other flights. The bags are carried from flight to flight by
airport handlers.

The simulation requires to provide the handlers' routes in order to bring all
bags to their final destination. For this reason, we can see it as a
routing problem.
